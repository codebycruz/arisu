# arisu

A painting program implemented entirely from scratch in LuaJIT.

> [!NOTE]
> The master branch is unstable and has regressed some features as it transitions from purely OpenGL to my cross-platform graphics library, [hood](https://github.com/codebycruz/hood).

## Requirements

- Linux (Recommended) or Windows
- Support for OpenGL 4.3 (you most certainly have this)
- _That's it._

There are no dependencies used by the library. Pure X11/Win32 and OpenGL.

## Goals

- [x] Fast
    - Best practices in the GPU pipeline and when writing LuaJIT code.
- [x] Written from scratch
    - **Zero** dependencies
- [x] Implement all painting operations on the GPU
    - Canvas is stored on the GPU and manipulated purely with compute shaders

## Showcase

## Running

1. Set up [lpm](https://github.com/codebycruz/lpm) on your system.
2. Run `lpm run` inside of `./packages/arisu`.

That's it. `lpm` contains a build of LuaJIT for you, and handles the installation of dependencies (in this case, only dependencies to itself).
